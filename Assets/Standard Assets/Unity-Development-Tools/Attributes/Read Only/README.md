# Read Only Attribute
The ***Read Only*** attribute allows to disable an exposed field in the inspector to remain locked and un-editable there. Useful when something is desired to be seen in the inspector, but want that code makes the changes.

#### End Result:

If any doubt on how to use the attribute arises, please see the provided examples for reference.

## General Notes
* If you switch the inspector to ***Debug Mode***, the fields will become editable. (In case you want to tweak something and never allow changes again).
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Read%20Only) instead of the whole project if you want to.
