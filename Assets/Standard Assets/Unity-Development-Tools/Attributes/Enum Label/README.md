# Enum Label Attribute
The ***Enum Label*** allows to provide a text alias for any option within a custom enum, as well as its instance. Esentially, instead of using the actual names of the enum elements, you can make them write anything you like, even with symbols.

#### End Result:

If any doubt on how to use the attribute arises, please see the provided examples for reference.

## General Notes
* The enum instance NEEDS to have the [EnumLabel] attribute as well, not only the enum declaration.
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Enum%20Label) instead of the whole project if you want to.
