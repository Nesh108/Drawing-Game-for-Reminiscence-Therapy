# Animator Parameter Attribute
The ***Animator Parameter*** attribute allows to easily pick between valid ***parameter*** names from an ***Animator*** and store it in a string for referencing. It also provides tools to filter based in parameter value type if needed.

If any doubt on how to use the attribute arises, please see the provided examples for reference.

## General Notes
* Beware that this attribute is somwhat sensitive to changes. If you switch/delete/rename or move the order of a ***parameter*** that was referenced from an ***Animator***, issues might arise, including losing said references when viewed again in the inspector.	
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Animator%20Parameter) instead of the whole project if you want to.
