# Scene Name Attribute
The ***Scene Name*** attribute allows to easily pick between valid scene names between those found in the ***Build Settings***. There is an option to filter out inactive scenes.

#### End Result:

If any doubt on how to use the attribute arises, please see the provided examples for reference.

## General Notes
* The scenes you can pick from are only those found in the ***Build Settings***.
* If a scene is renamed/removed from build settings/changed/substituted or the SceneManager asset is modified, there is a risk the reference to the scene name might get lost.
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Attributes/Scene%20Name) instead of the whole project if you want to.
