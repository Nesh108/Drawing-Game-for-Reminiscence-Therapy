# Favorites Panel
Editor window intended to store a Tree View where you add categories and can drag-and-drop objects from the Hierarchy or Project panel into.

As the name implies, this is intended to be used to save frequently used or important items within a project and scene.

## General Notes

* Once installed, the tool will be located on the top menu under the "Tools/Project/Favorite Assets" directory.
* The favorites panel will persist between sessions, the added items will be kept for the next time you open Unity. If you wish to have a list of items only for a short period of time (i.e. while you edit one scene), consider using the [Selection History Tool](https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/blob/master/Tools/Editor/Selection%20History/) instead.
* Items are added by drag and dropping them, and new categories are created via the "New Category" button.
* If you Double-click on an item on the panel, you will open it. This allows to quickly open scenes or view images.
* Right-click allows you to ping an item in the panel. 
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Tools/Favorites%20Panel) instead of the whole project if you want to.

## Favorites Panel Acknowledgments

* [plyoung](https://github.com/plyoung/Favourites) - For providing the whole, unedited tool, only improved by adding a confirmation panel before deleting elements, fixed a typo error within the .cs name files, and changed some window labels and descriptions for better clarity on what they do.
