## General Notes

* Once installed, you can use the tool by selecting different elements from the hierarchy and pressing "CTRL+G".
* This tool only works when two or more hierarchy items are selected.
* The parent position transform will be located in the middle ground of all selected elements.
* The position transform of the child objects will be changed to an offset of the newly created center point.
* Please note that this tool ***REQUIRES*** to be within an "Editor" named folder to work. (For more information about the reason, look at [Unity's official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/SpecialFolders.html).)
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Tools/Editor/Group%20Utility) instead of the whole project if you want to.
