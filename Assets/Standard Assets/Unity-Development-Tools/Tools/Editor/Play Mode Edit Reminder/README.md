# Play Mode Edit Reminder
A little snippet that will remind you that you are attempting to make changes on the inspector while the editor is running. Intended for those that often lose progress for forgetting to turn runtime off.

## General Notes

* The warning itself is activated whenever an object in hierarchy is selected while in runtime. In other words, the message won't appear just for clicking on a "void" in the scene window, but it WILL appear for clicking on something on the scene window.
* Please note that this tool ***REQUIRES*** to be within an "Editor" named folder to work. (For more information about the reason, look at [Unity's official documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/SpecialFolders.html).)
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Tools/Editor/Play%20Mode%20Edit%20Reminder) instead of the whole project if you want to.
