# Sticky Notes Gizmos
These are just a collection of small post-it notes icons that are used as a visual reference in the scene view for the [Sticky Notes Tool](https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Tools/Sticky%20Notes).

## General Notes

* These gizmos are included for the correct functionality of the [Sticky Notes Tool](https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Tools/Sticky%20Notes), so these are ***MANDATORY TO HAVE*** in order for that tool to work. Also, the names of these icons are hardcoded, so please refrain from renaming them.
* If you implement new colors or icons, for the sake of order you should also add them to this folder. Also if you *DO make more*, please consider sharing them for this repository, for this regard you can send an e-mail to contact@heisarzola.com
* You can [download this folder only](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/heisarzola/Unity-Development-Tools/tree/master/Gizmos/Sticky%20Notes) instead of the whole project if you want to.

## As A Reminder
