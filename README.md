# Interactive Drawing Game for People with Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a form of dementia causing memory, thinking, and behavior issues. There is no cure or treatment to stop or reverse its progression, but treatments are available to slow its development. Reminiscence Therapy (RT) is a widely recommended psychosocial treatment to help patients with AD and the elderly to support their individual identity and improve their mood. This study has the aim to research and test the use of an interactive drawing game for performing RT on people at early stages of AD. The game will leverage technology to allow patients to use hand gestures to draw scenes from their past with the goal of promote conversations and enhance memory recollection.

This is the prototype used in the final iteration of the study on the design of the Interactive Drawing Game for People with Alzheimer’s Disease.

# Motivation

The motivation for this project stems from the need to improve engagement and enjoyment during Reminiscence Therapy (RT) sessions for individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Traditional RT techniques can be found unengaging and uninteresting by either of the participants, leading to apathy and lack of participation. By incorporating an interactive drawing game, this project aims to overcome this issue by providing patients with a fun and engaging way to recall and discuss memories from their past. The use of technology to enable hand gestures for drawing also allows for physical and cognitive participation, further enhancing the overall experience of the therapy session, making them more enjoyable and engaging.

# Research Questions

1. To what extent, if any, does using an interactive drawing game increase the perceived fun of RT activities for the participants?
2. To what extent, if any, does an interactive drawing game promote participation in RT activities?

# System

The project requires a Microsoft Kinect (a Kinect Xbox One has been used) to be run. If needed, the mouse can be used as an alternative form of input (mainly for testing purposes).

# Results

From results of the study and user evaluations, it can be concluded that an interactive drawing game can promote participation and increase the perceived fun of RT sessions for both a caregiver and the elderly.
